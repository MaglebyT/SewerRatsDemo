    - 'Vaknim: Ah, Breaker. How are you feeling? '
    - "Breaker: Memory is still a bit hazy, but physically I feel like I\u2019ve
      been slow roasted in an electric chair. "
    - "Vaknim: It will pass. Your reanimation wasn\u2019t cheap, but I\u2019ll give
      you an opportunity to repay the debt."
    - I also have one of your belongings, a jetpack which Miles is fixing to return
      to you should you complete your task.
    - "Breaker: \u2026"
    - 'Vaknim: Breaker. Raze. I need you to do something for me. '
    - "Our town water has been contaminated by a poison the people are calling \u201Csludge\u201D."
    - "An intoxicating substance being created by a \u2018gang\u2019 who call themselves
      The Sewer Rats. "
    - "As you can guess, they have made the sewer into their hideout\u2014 living
      rent free! "
    - 'They are nothing more than a group of troubled youth bandit punks. Many of
      which are from this community. '
    - 'Can you imagine the shame they bring to their hard working relatives of my
      town!? '
    - 'Breaker: Okay so me and my mysterious sword guy companion here are supposed
      to beat up the Sewer Rats?'
    - "Raze: \u2026"
    - 'Vaknim: Raze will accompany you, yes. He also has a debt to pay me. I have
      other things I need to do right now. '
    - Ask around town if you have questions.
